# react-tutorial

Make sure you've installed Node.js (and peferably Visual Studio Code).

Open a terminal and write

```console 
npx create-react-app tutorialapp --typescript
```

The preceding code will create a react project in the folder ```tutorialapp```. When this is finished, run ```cd tutorialapp``` and run ```npm start```.
This will start the development server and render the changes in the browser as you save the files. 
Open the folder ```tutorialapp``` in VS Code, open up ```App.tsx```  and change some of the text in white (line 12 and/or 20), save the file and see the changes in the browser at ```http://localhost:3000```.

# Writing your own functional component

Delete the existing component (lines 6-24) and write your own component named ```App``` which returns a `<h1>` with the text 'My first React component'.
You should now have the following component in `App.tsx`:

```javascript
const YourComponentName: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <h1>My first React component</h1>
  );
}
```

## Rendering several JSX-elements (html-tags)
_When rendering more than one element, you need to render them inside a `<div>`-tag. A React component's return statement may not have several JSX-elements (HTML) in the same level.
For example, this is __not__ valid:_
```javascript
return(
  <h3>Vegard</h3>
  <h3>Alvsaker</h3>
  <h3>vegi@gmail.com</h3>
);
```

but this is:
```javascript
return(
  <div>
    <h3>Vegard</h3>
    <h3>Alvsaker</h3>
    <h3>vegi@gmail.com</h3>
  </div>
);
```

# Rendering a component from App
Below the `App`-component, create a new component which returns three `<h3>`-tags, where you insert a first name, a surname and an email. Hardcode these values for now.

Your `App.tsx` should now look something like this:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <h1>My first React component</h1>
  );
}

const Person: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Jens</h3>
      <h3>August</h3>
      <h3>jensaugust@hotelc√¶sar.no</h3>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
If you have saved your file, you will notice that were no changes in the browser. This is because `App` is the only component 
which is rendered. Therefore, we will need to render `Person` from `App`'s return statement. Add as many `<Person/>`s as you want

`App` should now look something like this:

```javascript
const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Person />
      <Person />
      <Person />
    </div>
  );
}
```
# Declaring a component's props

In order to avoid hard coding the name and email inside of the `Person`-component, we will need to pass this information through something called props. This will make the `Person`-component more reusable.

Before we can pass props to `Person`, we need to define which props the component can receive. This is a TypeScript specific feature.
Above the `Person`-component, add this code:

```javascript
type PersonProps = {
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  email: string
}
```

Now change the signature of `Person` from this:
```javascript
const Person: React.FC = () => {
```

to this: 
```javascript
const Person: React.FC<PersonProps> = props => {
```
This will tell the `Person`-component to use the PersonProps. The props is available by accessing the props parameter we just added. 


_The reason for replacing the parenthesis with `props`, instead of putting them inside the parenthesis `(props)` is because you don't need them when there is only one parameter. You don't have to think too much about this_

You will now have a red line under the `Person`-components, this is because we are not passing the required props. We will fix this after the next step.

Inside the return statement of `Person`, replace the hardcoded values with "First name: {props.firstName}" etc. In order to access an object's value inside of the return statement, you will need to wrap it in curly braces. To test this, try to write `props.firstname` without the curly braces

Your `Person`-component should now look like this:
```javascript
const Person: React.FC<PersonProps> = props => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>First name: {props.firstName}</h3>
      <h3>Last name: {props.lastName}</h3>
      <h3>email: {props.email}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}

```
